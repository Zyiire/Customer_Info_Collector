# Customer Information Collector (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that collects and displays customer information using **object-oriented programming principles**, including **inheritance**. The project features two Java classes:  
- `Person`: A base class that stores general personal information  
- `Customer`: A subclass that extends `Person` and includes customer-specific fields  

This structure demonstrates how to build reusable and extendable code through class inheritance in Java.
